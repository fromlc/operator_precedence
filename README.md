# Simplified Math and Logic Operator Precedence for C++
C++ expressions can include math and logical operators. To evaluate a C++ expression, follow this process:
- Evaluate math expressions first, then logical expressions
- We'll use these C++ math operators:
  - parentheses: ()
  - multiplication: *
  - division: /
  - modulus division: %
  - addtion: +
  - subtraction: -
  - We won't worry about exponentiation and unary minus for now.
- To evaluate a math expression, scan it left to right for the operator with the highest precedence.
- Apply this operator and re-scan the simplified expression.
- If all operators have the highest precedence, apply each operator going left to right.
- Parentheses have the highest precedence, so evaluate sub-expressions inside parentheses first.
- Next, evaluate multiplication and division going left to right.
- Last, evaluate addition and subtraction going left to right.
  - A simple example: (3 + 2) * 5 = 5 * 5 =  25
  - See the .cpp file for more examples.
- Logical expressions evaluate to either true or false.
- A zero (0) value is false, all other values are true.
- To evaluate a logical expression, scan it left to right for the operator with the highest precedence.
- Apply this operator and re-scan the simplified expression.
- We'll use these C++ logical operators:
  - parentheses: ()
  - negation, also called not: !
  - logical and: &&
  - logical or: ||
- If all operators have the highest precedence, apply each operator going left to right.
- Parentheses () have the highest precedence, so evaluate sub-expressions inside parentheses first.
- Next, evaluate negation ! going left to right.
- Next, evaluate logical and && going left to right.
- Last, evaluate logical or || going left to right.
  - A simple example: (1 || 0) && 0 = 1 && 0 = 0 
  - See the .cpp file for more examples.
